<p>In this post I will cover the spring boot microservice that I built. Microservice is has a Rest endpoint for flights and also provides receiving flight objects (the same ones that are exposed via Rest WS) via JMS queue - in this case ActiveMQ.</p>

<p>If this was only a microservice that would be boring. So I decided to include spring cloude ecosystem in to the mix.So in this project I added Eurika (discovery service) server, Spring boot actuator (to all projects), spring boot admin from Codecentric and finally from ordina.be microservice dashboard.</p>

<p>So letâ€™s break up the demo app into components.</p>
