<h2>
 Who am I?
</h2>

<p>
  This blog is something I wanted to do for a long time now, but never found the motivation/time to do it. So call this my new year's resolutions, finally getting around of doing it or something else, but I'm doing it now.
</p>

<p>
  So on to the blog - It's done with Jekyll and posted on GitHub. Reason for this is simple - it simple, and it's effective. Also I wanted to learn something new.
</p>

On to the topic you can expect here: 
<ul>
<li> Java and everything releated to it </li>
<li> Linux (I run Arch linux on my laptop) </li> 
<li> i3 window manager - also something that I run on my laptop and I thing it's awesome </li>  
<li> Bash - I think it's a lost art that too many people neglect, but everybody can benefit from it </li>
<li> Anything else I can think of, and I would like to share with the world</li>
